## Summary
For our project, we are going to leverage the Spotify Web API to collect data on what the popularity of certain music genres are throughout the globe. We will show charts that display the region on a map, the top artist in that genre, as well as a list of the runner up countries. We chose this topic as we believe it would be very interesting to view which genres are popular in different areas of the world, as well as discovering which artist is the most popular in that genre in that region.
